The project aims to work out how to put an AI in a safe ethical state without restricting it too much.
First, the boundary conditions and parameters should be worked out.
What makes an AI safe?
What makes an AI ethical?
What criteria does it depend on whether an AI corresponds to the two points of view?

STEPS:

1. List of all current and planned guidelines on safe and ethical AI. With content and author.
2. Summary of all regulations regarding safe and ethical AI.
3. Evaluate policies and rank them by importance.
4. Investigating how to achieve compliance with the main guidelines while respecting the specifications of our project
