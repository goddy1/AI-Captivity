Creating an ethical and safe AI

The project aims to work out how to put an AI in a safe ethical state without restricting it too much.
First, the boundary conditions and parameters should be worked out.
What makes an AI safe?
What makes an AI ethical?
What criteria does it depend on whether an AI corresponds to the two points of view?
